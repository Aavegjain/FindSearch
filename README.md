given a document text x and a pattern p, randPatternMatch(eps,p,x) returns all the occurrences of p in x, with a error probability bounded above by user specified value eps. 
similiarly, randPatternMatchWildcard(eps,p,x) returns all the occurrences of p in x with a error probability bounded above by user specified value eps, but allows for a wildcard character in the pattern p, which will not be matched with the text.
